Rough design of ProXR port application to interface between Elixir, a serial
port and ultimately the ProXR hosting relays and analog-to-digital
converters.

  Must implement the following capabilities:
  a. ping - {:ping, 0}
      success: {:pong}
  b. read all relays - {:read_relays, 0}
      success: {:ok, integer}
  c. read all A/D converters
      Send three (3) bytes, return sixteen (16) bytes
  d. switch all relays off - {:all_off, 0}
      success: {:ok}
  e. switch all relays on - {:all_on, 0}
      success: {:ok}
  f. change position of all relays
