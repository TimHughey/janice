				MQTT processing is divided into two tasks:
				  1. Sending and receiving all MQTT messages (this configuration value)
					2. Processing messages (e.g. parsing JSON) to hand-off to Engine tasks for action

				This value configures the priority of the sending and receiving task.

				It is advisable for this task to be a higher priority than the inbound processing
				task to ensure that messages are overall sent and received with minimal delay.

					 2. Wait for outbound messages to send

				This value configures how long (in milliseconds) to wait for an inbound message.

				It is advisable to match this value with the outbound message wait to best balance the
				processing of inbound and outbound messages.
